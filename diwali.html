	<p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important Hindu festivals, celebrated with great enthusiasm across India and around the world. The festival marks the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil, symbolized by the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom after defeating the demon king Ravana, as narrated in the ancient Indian epic, the Ramayana. Traditionally, people celebrate Diwali by decorating their homes with oil lamps (diyas), fireworks, and rangoli, and by exchanging gifts and sweets. It also holds significance for Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists, who associate the day with various religious events, such as the release of Guru Hargobind Ji from imprisonment and Lord Mahavira's attainment of Nirvana.</p>
