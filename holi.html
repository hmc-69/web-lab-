	<p>Holi, often referred to as the Festival of Colors, is a vibrant Hindu festival that celebrates the arrival of spring, the victory of good over evil, and the renewal of love and relationships. It is best known for the joyous tradition of throwing colorful powders, dancing, singing, and feasting, all while people come together to play and share moments of joy. The festival's origins lie in several ancient myths, including the story of Prahlad, a devoted prince who was saved from a deadly fire by Lord Vishnu, symbolizing the triumph of devotion and faith over evil. Holi also celebrates the playful and loving relationship between Lord Krishna and Radha, which is why it's particularly lively in regions associated with Krishna's life, like Mathura and Vrindavan.</p>
