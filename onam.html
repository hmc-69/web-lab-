	<p>Onam is a major harvest festival celebrated predominantly in Kerala, India, marking a time of joy, prosperity, and community togetherness. The festival is rooted in the legend of King Mahabali, a benevolent demon king who was beloved by his people but was exiled to the underworld. Onam commemorates his annual return to visit his subjects, during which the people of Kerala celebrate his homecoming with elaborate feasts, traditional dances, boat races, and vibrant floral decorations called *pookalam*. The highlight of the festivities is the *Onam Sadya*, a grand vegetarian banquet with multiple dishes served on a banana leaf, symbolizing abundance and the spirit of sharing.</p>
